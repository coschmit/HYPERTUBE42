# Hypertube

## About the Project
This project goal was to create a web application allowing a user to search and view videos. A streaming website actually ^^

The player will be directly integrated into the site, and the videos will be downloaded using the BitTorrent protocol.
Once an item is selected, it will be downloaded to the server and broadcast on the web player at the same time.
So the player will not only display the video when the download is complete, but will be able to stream the stream directly.

This project was created with Node.js, Express.js, and using Ejs template engine

## Run It
```
npm i
npm start
```
